              The humble T-shirt originated in the early 20th century as an
              undergarment worn by workers and soldiers. Its simple design and
              comfort quickly made it a popular piece of casual clothing
              worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1950s and 60s, T-shirts became a canvas for self-expression
              through printed slogans, band logos, and artwork, turning them
              into an iconic symbol of youth culture and rebellion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, T-shirts are a staple in fashion, embraced by all ages and
              styles. They continue to evolve with new materials, fits, and
              designs, reflecting personal and cultural identities across the
              globe.
